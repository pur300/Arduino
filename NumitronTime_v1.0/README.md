This library is used to drive numitron tubes which are connected to six shift registers TPIC6B595N. Function setTime() sets time to numitron tubes. If you want to drive more than six digits, you have to modify function setTime() or
add a new function which will have an ability to drive an arbitrary number of tubes.
