Weather library is used to interact with humidity, temperature and pressure sensors. It uses different functions which simplify reading those sensors.
Library is intended to be used for reading BMP085 pressure sensor. However, it can also be used for reading data from the DHT11 humidity sensor.
Both sensors(BMP085 and DHT11) can also be used for temperature measuring.

Version 1.0 has the following features:

- Function for reading temperature
- Functions for reading pressure in bars or pascals,
- Function for reading humidity,
- Function for reading of altitude.
