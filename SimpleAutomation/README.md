This code is used to control light and a water pump via web page, which is generated when a user sends a HTTP request to an Arduino web server(you should send the request on port 80). The code provides two modes for light and the water pump:
* Automatic mode
* Manual mode

In automatic mode, the system automatically controls water flow and light intensity. In manual mode, the user has an ability to manually turn on/off the water pump and ligh.

Conponents used in this project are:
* Digital AC dimmer(http://www.inmojo.com/store/inmojo-market/item/digital-ac-dimmer-module-lite-v.2/)
* Arduino uno
* Arduino ethernet shield
* Water pump
* Photoresistor
